It is open to the Body of Christ to walk together as family to whatever extent the Lord releases them to do so. Our heart is to embrace all believers, all denominations, and para-churches. And just like a family, we desire to walk together with each generation. Old and young alike, all have an important role to play in a family, and all are needed to make a family complete.",about_homecoming_gathering_paragraph_2:"Unlike a conference with pre-determined speakers and pre-set teachings, in a gathering believers answer a call from the Lord to come together to worship and wait before Him, posturing themselves to hear what the Spirit is saying to the Church. A team of seasoned mature leaders provides spiritual oversight and protection in the meetings, as they walk together to discern what the Lord is saying through the body and facilitate the working of the Holy Spirit.",giving:"Giving",check:"Check",check_description_html:'Please write your offering check to <b><i><u>Travis Christian Assembly</u></i></b> with <b><i><u>"Overseas Chinese Homecoming Gathering"</u></i></b> as the memo, and mail it to the following address:',zelle:"Zelle",zelle_description_html:'Please type in <b><i><u>chase@tcaweb.org</u></i></b> as the recipient for your Zelle payments (e.g. via Chase QuickPay), and type in <b><i><u>"Overseas Chinese Homecoming Gathering"</u></i></b> as the notes.',paypal:"PayPal",paypal_description:"Click the button below to give via Paypal.
